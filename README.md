Converting C++ to Pseudocode — Building Another Transformer Model that is the opposite of the previous one



Understanding complex code can be challenging, especially when documentation is lacking. In my latest project, I built a Transformer-based model that reverses the typical code generation process—translating C++ code back into human-readable pseudocode.



Using the SPoC dataset, I trained the model by swapping input and output roles, making C++ the source and pseudocode the target. The model architecture remains a custom Transformer with embeddings, positional encodings, and an encoder-decoder design, all implemented in PyTorch.



Key Highlights:

Automating code understanding through deep learning.

Efficient training and streamlined logging using a dynamic progress bar in Streamlit.

Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces, allowing real-time C++ to pseudocode conversion.

This project demonstrates how AI can assist developers by bridging the gap between raw code and human comprehension. Whether for documentation, debugging, or learning, such tools make programming more accessible.
